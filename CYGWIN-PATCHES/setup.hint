sdesc: "Universal NFS server."
ldesc: "This package contains an NFS daemon (rpc.nfsd) and a mount daemon (rpc.mountd).
Unlike other NFS daemons, this NFS server runs entirely in user space. This makes
it a tad slower than other NFS implementations, and also introduces some
awkwardnesses in the semantics (for instance, moving a file to a different
directory will render its file handle invalid)."
